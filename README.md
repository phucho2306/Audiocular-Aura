## 🚀 What is AuraPEQ?

Normally, software equalizers run as background processes on your computer or phone, which consumes CPU resources and can degrade audio quality. **AuraPEQ communicates directly with the DSP chip inside your DAC hardware.**

When you save your custom EQ settings, they are written permanently to the DAC's internal flash memory. **Your custom tuning persists when plugged into any device** (iPhone, Android, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, iPad, etc.)—completely app-free and driverless!

## ✨ Features

*   🔊 **Hardware-Level DSP**: RBJ cookbook filters (Peak, Low Shelf, High Shelf) processed directly on the DAC.
*   ⚡ **Instant Real-Time Sync**: Smooth visualizer edits (Gain, Freq, Q) are throttled and pushed instantly to the device.
*   🔄 **EQ A/B Comparison**: Swap between slot configurations to easily compare presets.
*   ↩️ **Undo/Redo History**: Debounced state-based history traversal (up to 50 snapshots depth) with hardware sync.
*   🌐 **Translation System (i18n)**: Fully localized UI in English, Spanish, German, and Simplified Chinese.
*   ⌨️ **Power-User Shortcuts**: Dedicated keyboard mappings for Windows/Mac (Ctrl/Cmd) to control the visualizer, reset bands, and sync settings.
*   📂 **Preset Import & Database**: Load AutoEq parametric text profiles or search thousands of IEM/headphone models from the online database.
